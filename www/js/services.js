There are multiple styles within this dance including East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, Lindy Hop and even Charleston, all of which we incorporate into our lessons. At Imagine RIT we show off what Boppers have learned in the past year in choreographed form; some classic and some completely original. This year, classic dances include line dances the Shim Sham and the Hat Trick Shim Sham. Our original choreographed dances are to the songs Black Coffee by The Careless Lovers, Let it Roll Again by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy (both choreographed by Katie Kauchick and Colin Shaffer, past members) and All About that (Upright) Bass by Postmodern Jukebox, a jazz cover to Meghan Trainors' pop music hit. We will also be showcasing the various styles as mentioned above in order to educate those who are unfamiliar with what they look like and the differences between them.
